## Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog, I'm glad you're here! I primarily use it as a tool to document the things I learn and communicate the ideas that I have. It's a great excuse to experiment with web design/development and practice communicating through writing.

To create the blog, I used a [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) starter called [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen). The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and content is editable via [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

I love CSS, and I am forcing myself not to go crazy and rewrite the styles. The Lumen team did a great job! In the future, I'll probably revamp things more to my personal style.

See you around!
