title: Web Components 2019
---

I heard about Web Components for the first time on [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/276-web-components/), back in the fall of 2017. The idea sounded amazing, but when [Dave](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) & [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) talked about browser support and the end to the HTML Imports spec, I kinda got bummed out.

The progress of the web moves incredibly fast, a lot of things have happened since [episode 276](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/276-web-components/) aired: browser support has improved, new specs have landed, and some pretty great tooling has emerged. I think it's time to take another look.

**Spoiler alert, things are looking pretty great!**

## ‚è≥ TL;DR

Web components are ideal candidates for delivering design systems in organizations where tech stacks rely on a variety of front-end frameworks and libraries. They can reduce dependency-hell and spaghetti-code by encapsulating styling and behavior‚Äîwrite once and use them wherever HTML works (polyfills required).

_Note: Web Components may not be great candidates for full-fledged single page apps (as of today) due to some temporary accessibility limitations with the shadow DOM and [Accessibility Object Model (AOM)](http://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html) specs. Fear not, browsers support is on the way!_

## What are Web Components?

"Web Components" represent a collection of browser specifications that allow designers and developers to create and reuse custom HTML tags that can deliver scoped styles and custom behaviors‚Äîthe specs are:

-   [**Custom Elements**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements): create your own HTML tags‚ÄîB.Y.O.T(ag).
-   [**Shadow DOM**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM): provide scoped styles and behaviors by isolating DOM nodes (sounds spooky)
-   [**HTML Templates**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots): define element structure and expose "entry-points" (slots) to pass in children elements
-   [**JavaScript Modules**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/): export and import reusable code

### As Defined by Webcomponents.org:

<figure>
  <blockquote>...a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps... [web components] work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.</blockquote>

### How do you make Web Components?

Web components can be made with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. You can find some in-depth resources on MDN's [Concepts and Usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). Keep in mind that older browsers will need some support via polyfills and take extra care to ensure accessibility.

Personally, I find the ergonomics of writing vanilla JS for Web Components to be a little uncomfortable. If that's your jam, you rock! ü§ò

### StencilJS ‚Äî¬†FTW!

Lucky for me there are some tools out there that take the pain out of building web components. I'm a big fan of [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/). As they say on their website: "Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any modern browser."

**Note: Stencil is not Ionic!** While the Ionic team is behind Stencil, it's a stand-alone tool that does not have any depended on the Ionic framework.

I like to think of Stencil as somewhat of a Sass-like tool for web components. It's a complier that outputs optimized vanilla JS while also taking care of polyfills (reminds me of Autoprefixer for CSS).

### Stencil announced at 2017 Polymer Summit

I've qued up the video to the point where they announce Stencil. If you want more of the backstory, I recommend watching from the beginning.

### Leveling Up ++

If you want to learn more about how to build web components with (or without) Stencil, I highly recommend this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/web-components-stenciljs-build-custom-html-elements/) by [Maximilian](https://twitter.com/maxedapps):
